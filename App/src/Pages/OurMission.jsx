        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Our mission at Paws and Claws is to provide a safe, caring, and welcoming environment for pets in need of a new home, with a focus on supporting the adoption of older pets and puppies. We believe that every pet deserves a second chance, and we are committed to offering the highest level of care and support to all of the animals in our adoption program.</p>
        <p>We are dedicated to finding loving families for every animal in our care, and to supporting the well-being of both pets and their new owners every step of the way. We offer a range of resources and support services to help ensure a smooth and successful transition to a new home, including training and behavior support, medical care, and ongoing support for pet owners.</p>
        <p>At Paws and Claws, we also strive to educate the community about the importance of responsible pet ownership and the benefits of adopting from a shelter or rescue. We believe that by working together, we can make a positive impact on the lives of pets and people in our community, regardless of the age or breed of the pet.</p>
